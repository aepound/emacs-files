emacs-files
===========

This is a repository that collects my configuration for my emacs.

In order to set this up, it only requires:
  1) a git clone into the home directory
  2) the $HOME environment variable to be defined
  3) and then a symlink or a copy of the .emacs file to be placed in the home dir.
